# CoinSpotDotNet
A .NET Standard 2.0 wrapper library for the CoinSpot API v1 and v2.

## Features
 - Well documented with a [full suite of examples](https://github.com/liamwhan)
 - .NET Standard 2.0 target
 - No 3rd-party dependencies (no `Newtonsoft.Json`, this library uses the `System.Text.Json` serialiser out of the box), only `Microsoft` and `System` namespaced dependecies required
 - Supports both Console and ASP.NET web application scenarios, and probably loads of others.
 - Modern fully `async` C# library
 - Currently supports CoinSpot all public and read-only [API v1](https://coinspot.com.au/api) and [API v2 (beta)](https://coinspot.com.au/v2/api) endpoints:
 - Write endpoints are currently not implemented but planned for 1.3.0 release
